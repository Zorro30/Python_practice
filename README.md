-> These are the basic problems I have been solving to learn python.

-> This repository also includes some codes which are used to automate some of the mundane tasks.

Monkey Patching:

In Python, the term monkey patch refers to dynamic (or run-time) modifications of a class or module. In Python, we can actually change the behavior of code at run-time.

-> check monk.py and monk_f.py for example.
